## Quit your job

This repo helps you to keep an overview how many days are still to come
until you're finally out - respecting workdays vs. holidays.

### Configuration

You will find everything to simply configure your own within `quit.config.js` .
Configure it and run it. That's it.

### tl;dr

1. Configure `quit.config.js`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
